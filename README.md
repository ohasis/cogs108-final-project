This data analysis was created as a part of the final project my group and I worked on while taking the course **COGS 108: Data Science in Practice**.

It reflects the knowledge gleaned from the datasets we gathered from Kaggle, all related to video games. It reflects the knowledge learned as part of this course, including:

* Grocery Shopping Habits
* Managing Groceries at Home
* Monitoring Expiration Dates

### Research Question

How do combinations of different video game genres and developer company scale affect the discrepancy between aggregate user and critical reviews, and how does this discrepancy in turn impact the sales performance of these video games in different global markets?

Although there is a timeline cataloging the completion of each facet of the project, their order is listed here for convenience:
